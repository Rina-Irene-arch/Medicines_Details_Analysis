# Medicines Details Analysis Final Capstone Internship Project

## Project Overview
The pharmaceutical industry faces the challenge of managing vast amounts of data related to the composition, uses, and side effects of medicines. As the number of available medications continues to grow, healthcare providers need reliable insights to prescribe the most effective treatments while minimizing adverse effects. Additionally, understanding the distribution of medicine usage and patient satisfaction can help pharmaceutical companies improve their offerings.
